# Summary

- To demonstrate and compare the use of design patterns and lambda functions, I have implemented the scenario of 5Guys receipt and package slip printing.
- The design pattern used for the same purpose is Strategy.
- The slip can be printed using two strategies - Receipt Strategy & Package Slip Strategy.
- Design pattern helps decoupling of the objects, however it adds an overhead in the number of files/classes for each strategy.
- The Lambda functions on the other side help to implement the same logic in a single class file. 
- This results in a very concise code as there is no need to add additional interfaces and classes in the solution.
- Also, the code becomes readable and easy to understand in a single class file.

## Lab 9 submission-

- The folder 'java-pattern-impl' has implementation using the strategy design pattern.
- The folder 'java-lambda-impl' has implementation using lambda functions.
